# Risk management data analysis using Power BI: Crime dashboard
Here is one of the projects I completed for some risk management organisations that I have worked with. It is a crime dashboard, that shows the risk of crime that individuals and businesses face while carrying out day-to-day activities. I have accumulated **over 3 years** of experience using Power BI for data analysis and creating dashboards for physical risk data that also include terrorism threats, protests, country economic analyses, and other environmental threats that may adversely affect business operations for various countries across Africa. I have been able to leverage my data science knowledge to help simplify threat assessments with readily accessible insights with organized data.
Data for the crime dashboard was sourced from SharePoint on Azure connected to back-end SQL Server. Some data was sourced from excel spreadsheets and appended. The main issue I encountered while working on this project is that the organization’s SharePoint database did not have clean data, which I cleaned and transformed using Power Query Editor. The data was not properly organized, not fully filled in, and neither was it searchable. Therefore, data cleaning/ wrangling took a significant amount of time but was crucial in preparing the data for analysis. It was also imperative to create a well-developed data model using the Star Schema approach to help fully communicate the organization’s information. DAX also helped in creating new information from the data that was already in the model.
The dashboards helped to track real-time changes in operational risk and provide data-driven advice for businesses and other international organizations.
